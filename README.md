# Jobbnorge Block

> **NOTE**: Breaking change in 2.0.0: The Public Jobbnorge API is used, and you will have to use and add the employerID. You get the employerID from your Jobbnorge contact.  The old block is still available in the 1.0 branch and releases.

> Also available at https://wordpress.org/plugins/jobbnorge-block/


This WordPress plugin adds a block to the Gutenberg editor that displays a list of jobs from Jobbnorge.

The block html look like this, and uses the following classes for styling:

```html
<ul class="has-employer has-dates has-scope has-excerpts wp-block-dss-jobbnorge">
	<li class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item">
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-title"><a
				href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/ledige-stillinger/stilling/XXXXXX">Title</a></div>
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-meta">
			<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-employer">Employer</div>
			<time datetime="2023-11-26T00:00:00+00:00" class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-deadline">Deadline:
				1/1/1970</time>
			<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-scope">Scope: Full time</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wp-block-dss-jobbnorge__item-excerpt">The excerpt … <a
				href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/ledige-stillinger/stilling/XXXXXX">Read more</a>
		</div>
	</li>
	.
	.
	.
</ul>
```

`is-grid`, `columns-N` (N = 2-6), `has-employer`, `has-excerpts`, `has-deadline` and `has-scope` are added to the `<ul>` element depending on the block settings.

Default styling is provided by the [`style.scss`](src/style.scss) file.
